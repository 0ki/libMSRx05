<dd>This page contains an explanation about the format of the three magnetic
tracks in standard identification cards, particularly those used in financial
transactions, i.e., credit and debit cards. It is a summary of the
international standards <a href=
"http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=31441&ICS1=35&ICS2=240&ICS3=15">
ISO 7813</a> (tracks 1 and 2) and <a href=
"http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=33583&ICS1=35&ICS2=240&ICS3=15">
ISO 4909</a> (track 3).<br>

<ul>
<li>Track 1 (IATA)<br><br>

  Up to 79 ALPHA 7-bit (including parity) characters (alphanumeric) including
  SS, ES and LRC. Read only. It comprises the following fields (in this order):
  <br><br>

  <ul>
  <li>SS: Start Sentinel. 1 character: %.<br><br>

  <li>FC: Format Code. 1 character (alphabetic only):<br><br>

      A: Reserved for proprietary use of card issuer.<br>
      B: Bank/financial. This is the format described here.<br>
      C-M: Reserved for use by ANSI Subcommittee X3B10.<br>
      N-Z: Available for use by individual card issuers.<br><br>

  <li>PAN: Primary Account Number. Up to 19 digits:<br><br>

      In accordance with the account numbering scheme in <a href=
"http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=31443&ICS1=35&ICS2=240&ICS3=15">
      ISO 7812.</a><br><br>

      It consists of the following parts:<br><br>

      <ul>
      <li>IIN: Issuer Identification Number. Up to 6 digits:<br><br>

          It consists of the following parts:<br><br>

          <ul>
          <li>MII: Major Industry Identifier. Up to 2 digits:<br><br>

              0: Reserved for future use by ISO/TC 68.<br>
              00: Institutions other than card issuers.<br>
              1: Airlines.<br>
              2: Airlines and other future assignments.<br>
              3: Travel and entertainment.<br>
              4: Banking/financial.<br>
              5: Banking/financial.<br>
              59: Financial institutions not registered by ISO.<br>
              6: Merchandising and banking.<br>
              7: Petroleum.<br>
              8: Telecommunications and other future assignments.<br>
              89: Telecommunications administrations and private operating
              agencies.<br>
              9: Reserved for national use.<br><br>

          <li>II: Issuer Identifier. Up to 5 digits:<br><br>

              Identifies the issuer. In some cases the first digit indicates
              the length of the IIN or the responsibility of its assignment
              outside of ISO. If MII = 9 then the first 3 digits should be the
              country code (CC).<br><br>
          </ul>

      <li>IAI: Individual Account Identification. Up to 12 digits:<br><br>

          Assigned by the card issuing institution.<br><br>

      <li>CD: Check Digit. 1 digit:<br><br>

          Calculated using the Luhn formula for computing modulus 10
          "double-add-double" check digit: Double the value of alternate (odd)
          digits starting by the least significant (first right hand) digit.
          Then add the individual digits of doubled (odd) numbers and even
          digits of the original number. If the value ends in 0 then the check
          digit is 0. Otherwise subtract the value from the next higher number
          ending in 0 (tens complement of the unit digit). The result is the
          check digit. Example: If the account number without check digit is
          1234 5678 9012 344 then (8) + 4 + (6) + 2 + (2) + 0 + (1 + 8) + 8 +
          (1 + 4) + 6 + (1 + 0) + 4 + (6) + 2 + (2) = 65, therefore the check
          digit is 70 - 65 = 5 and so the complete account number is
          1234 5678 9012 3445.<br><br>
      </ul>

      is used in a new cycle. Then it is modified accordingly.<br><br>

  <li>CB: Cycle Begin (Validity Date). 4 digits:<br><br>

      Date in which actual cycle began. The format is YDDD where Y stands for
      the least significant digit of the year and DDD is the day of the year
      (001 to 366). The field must be updated each time a new cycle begin.<br>

  <li>RC: Retry Count. 1 digit:<br><br>

      Number of remaining PIN trials. It is initialized to 3 and reduced by one

      for the algorithm. Next 4 digits are PIN offset, a complementary value of
      PIN so customers can change their PIN, or PVV.<br><br>

      0: No restrictions.<br>
      1: No cash dispense.<br>
      2: No point of sale (POS) transaction.<br>
      3: No cash dispense and no POS transaction.<br>
      4: Authorization required.<br>
      5-7: Reserved for future use by ISO/TC 68.<br>
      8-9: Reserved for card issuer's internal use, only local use and under
      agreement.<br><br>

  <li>FSANSR: FSAN Service Restriction. 2 digits:<br><br>

      Same values and meaning as for PANSR field.<br><br>

  <li>SSANSR: SSAN Service Restriction. 2 digits:<br><br>

      Same values and meaning as for PANSR field.<br><br>

  <li>ED: Expiry Date. 4 digits: YYMM.<br><br>

      If this field is not used a FS will be in place.<br><br>

  <li>CSN: Card Sequence Number. 1 digit:<br><br>

      Allows to distinguish among different cards with the same PAN. It is
      incremented by one unit in any additional card.<br><br>

      If FC = 02 and a FS is in place it means that field ACSN is present.<br>
      <br>

  <li>CScN: Card Security Number. 9 digits:<br><br>

      The first digit represents the algorithm used to calculate a verification
      value to validate the information on the magnetic track against the
      embossed characters, where 0-4 are available for national use, 5-8 are
      available for international security methods given by ISO/TC 68, and 9 is
      reserved for private use. Next 8 digits are the verification value.<br>
      <br>

      <ul>
      <li>TD: Transaction Date. 4 digits:<br><br>

          Date of last cash dispense. The format is YDDD where Y stands for the
          least significant digit of the year and DDD is the day of the year
          (001 to 366).<br><br>

      <li>INIC: International Network Identification Code. 3 digits:<br><br>

          Code for identification of an international group of issuers, when
          the IIN can not be used. It is equivalent to the term Network
          International Identifier used in <a href=
